PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH CLASSIFICATION
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model to predict continuous target variables. By using a synthetic dataset, the project showcases the process of training a linear regression model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

Utilize a dataset with labeled data and apply classification algorithms to build predictive
models. Preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and explore various
classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or
support vector machines. Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1- score, and compare their performances to determine the most suitable
algorithm for the given task
Data Preparation:

Creation of a synthetic dataset with feature X and target variable y.
Data Splitting:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Training a linear regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics on both training and testing data.
Visualization:

Plotting the regression line to visualize the relationship between X and y.
Visualizing actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing and evaluating the linear regression model.
Key Insights
The linear regression model helps in understanding the linear relationship between the feature X and the target variable y.
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics provide a quantitative measure of the model's performance.
Visualizing the regression line and the actual vs. predicted values gives a clear indication of how well the model fits the data.
